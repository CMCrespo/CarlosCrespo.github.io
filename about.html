						<p>
							I enlisted in the Coast Guard in July 1999 and was assigned to USCGC DEPENDABLE in Portsmouth, VA, following graduation from Recruit Basic Training. In 2001 was accepted to attend Officer Candidate School (OCS). Upon graduation from OCS in 2002, was assigned to a staff tour at the Coast Guard Personnel Command and served as Special Correspondence Officer. Upon completion of the staff tour in 2004, served as Executive Officer of Station Fort Lauderdale. In 2007 was assigned to Sector San Juan where served as Command Duty Officer and Contingency Planner. In 2011 was assigned as the Maritime Homeland Security / Defense Program Manager for Coast Guard Pacific Area. Since 2015, I have been serving as the Chief of Enforcement at Sector Delaware Bay in Philadelphia. As part of my responsibilities, I oversee law enforcement and homeland security in the Mid-Atlantic Region and Delaware River. I also manage maritime Search and Rescue missions.

							I was born and raised in Puerto Rico and moved to the United States when I joined the Coast Guard. My wife and I, along with our two boys, enjoy traveling, camping, sports, and music.
